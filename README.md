#Advent Of Code 2016
My solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016/) in C.

Everything in this repo is free to use and learn from.

## Compilation
All of the solutions can be compiled simply by visiting their directories and using the `make` command.

The resulting binary will be named `prgm`, and any solutions requiring an input file will look for a file named `INPUT` (case sensitive).

## Note
All of the solutions are tested using the `INPUT-example` file found in each directory. All binaries are tested on Debian Linux 8 (jessie).
